    <h2>A bit about me.</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone, my name is Jorge, a Physics/Mathematics double with an emphasis in Mathematical Mechanics, focusing on understanding what the geometry behind these concepts and what is trying to tell me.</p>

<p>I am currently working on an independent project to model the Hamiltonian Dynamics of Charged Particles to:</p>
<p> - Compare numerical methods for solving Hamiltonian plasma equations.</p>
<p> - Investigate stability conditions in relativistic plasma Hamiltonians.</p>
<p> - Find new behavior in plasma distributions near strong-field regions.</p>

<h3>Interests and Hobbies Outside My Major</h3>

<p> - As someone who likes to take an active role in understanding societal mechanics, I believe it is important to have a grasp of the infrastructure and education of healthcare and the influence it has on the lives within a community.</p>
<p> - More broadly, the subject of psychological economics and economic history is something I enjoy exploring and discussing at leisure.</p>
<p> - I have been in and out of many rock, funk, metal, and R&B bands as a guitarist and spend hours of my weekend doing improv.</p>
<p> - I also have a lot of fun with social dancing (Caribbean) and walking everywhere.</p>
