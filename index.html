    <h2>A bit about me.</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone, my name is Jorge, a Physics/Mathematics doubble with an emphasis in Mathematical Physics, and understanding what the geometry behind it is telling me.</p>
    <p>I am currently woking on an independant project to model the Hamiltonian Dynamics of Charged Particles to:</p>
    <p> - Compare numerical methods for solving Hamiltonian plasma equations.</p>
    <p> - Investigate stability conditions in relativistic plasma Hamiltonians.</p>
    <p> - Find new behavior in plasma distributions near strong-field regions.</p>

    <h3>Interest and hobbies, ouside my major</h3>
    <p> - As an individual who likes to take an ative role in undestanding soicetal mechanics. I belive it is importnat to have a grasp on the infastrucure and education of healthcare and the influence it plays within the lives in a community </p>
    <p> - More boradly, the subject of phycological economics and economic history is something I like to pick at and discuss at leasure.</p>
    <p> - I have been in and out of many rock/funk/metal/R&B bands as guitar, and spend hours of my weekend doing improv.</p>
    <p> - I also have alot of fun with social dancing(carribian) and walking everywhere.</p>
